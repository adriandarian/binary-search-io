# Dot Product

The **dot product** of two lists is the sum of the products of their corresponding entries.

For example, given `a = [1, 2, 3]` and `b = [4, 5, 6]`, the dot product is 32, since (1 × 4) + (2 × 5) + (3 × 6) = 32.

Given two lists of integers, compute their dot product.

## Example 1

### Input

```javascript
a = []
b = []
```

### Output

```javascript
0
```

## Example 2

### Input

```javascript
a = [1, 2, 3]
b = [4, 5, 6]
```

### Output

```javascript
32
```

## Example 3

### Input

```javascript
a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
b = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

### Output

```javascript
55
```
