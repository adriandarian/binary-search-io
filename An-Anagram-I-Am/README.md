# An anagram I am

Given two strings `s0` and `s1`, return whether they are anagrams of each other. Two words are anagrams when you can rearrange one to become the other. For example, `"listen"` and `"silent"` are anagrams.

### Constraints

- Length of s0 and s1 is at most 5000.

## Example 1

### Input

```python
s0 = "listen"
s1 = "silent"
```

### Output

```python
True
```

## Example 2

### Input

```python
s0 = "bedroom"
s1 = "bathroom"
```

### Output

```python
False
```
