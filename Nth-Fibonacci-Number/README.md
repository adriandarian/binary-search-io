# Nth Fibonacci Number

The Fibonacci sequence goes like this: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ...

The next number can be found by adding up the two numbers before it, and the first two numbers are always 1.

Write a function that takes an integer `n` and returns the `n`th Fibonacci number in the sequence.

> Note: `n` will be less than or equal to `30`.

## Example 1

### Input

```javascript
n = 1
```

### Output

```javascript
1
```

### Explanation

This is the base case and the first fibonacci number is defined as `1`.

## Example 2

### Input

```javascript
n = 6
```

### Output

```javascript
8
```

### Explanation

Since `8` is the `6`th fibonacci number: `1`, `1`, `2`, `3`, `5`, `8`.

## Example 3

### Input

```javascript
n = 7
```

### Output

```javascript
13
```

### Explanation

Since `13` is the seventh number: `1`, `1`, `2`, `3`, `5`, `8`, `13`
