# Chunky strings

Given a string `s` and an integer `n`, split up `s` into `n`-sized pieces.

For example, given:

```javascript
s = "abcdefg"
n = 3
```

Return `["abc", "def", "g"]`.

If there are extra characters left over, they should be in its own piece.

## Example 1

### Input

```javascript
s = "abcdef"
n = 2
```

### Output

```javascript
["ab", "cd", "ef"]
```
