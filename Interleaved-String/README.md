# Interleaved string

Given two strings `s0` and `s1`, return the two strings interleaved, starting with `s0`. If there are leftover characters in a string they should be added to the end.

## Example 1

### Input

```javascript
s0 = "abc"
s1 = "xyz"
```

### Output

```javascript
"axbycz"
```

## Example 2

### Input

```javascript
s0 = "abc"
s1 = "x"
```

### Output

```javascript
"axbc"
```
